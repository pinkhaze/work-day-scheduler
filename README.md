# Work Day Scheduler
Third-Party APIs: Word Day Scheduler

## Description

The purpose of this project is to add jQuery functionality to starter code for a work day scheduler. In addition, the work day scheduler demonstrates the following jQuery skills:
 * using the Day.js library in the browser
 * adding and removing classes
 * using DOM traversal to grab id attributes
 * setting and getting user input to and from local storage

In order to meet requirements, the deployed work day scheduler application should have the following capabilities:
 * displays the current date at the top of the webpage
 * displays a set of timeblocks matching standard business hours 
 * the timeblocks are color coded to reflect the following:
        * gray: past timeblock
        * red: present timeblock
        * green: future timeblock
 * allows the user to click on a timeblock and enter an event
 * clicking the save button for a timeblock saves the text for the even in local storage
 * refreshing the page 
 * saved events persist after refreshing the page
